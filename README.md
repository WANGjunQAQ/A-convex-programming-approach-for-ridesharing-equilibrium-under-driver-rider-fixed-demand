# A-convex-programming-approach-for-ridesharing-equilibrium-under-driver-rider-fixed-demand
This repository is created for storing the data and code of an algorithm implemented to solve ridesharing equilibrium under driver/rider fixed demand. In order to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach, several experiments with varied network scale are conducted.
